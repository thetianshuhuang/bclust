# Bayesian Markov Chain Clustering

Implementation of Markov Chain Bayesian Clustering techniques, including DPM (Dirichlet Process Mixture Models [1]) and MFM (Mixture of Finite Mixtures [2]) mixture models, with an abstract Mixture Model and Component Model API.

Hyperparameter updates for DPM are implemented using an Empirical Bayes update procedure [3].

Final configuration selection is implemented using Least Squares clustering [4].
