Description: Implementation of Markov Chain Bayesian Clustering techniques,
	including DPM (Dirichlet Process Mixture Models) and MFM (Mixture of Finite Mixtures) mixture models, with an abstract Mixture Model and Component Model API.
	Hyperparameter updates for DPM are implemented using an Empirical Bayes update procedure.
	Final configuration selection is implemented using Least Squares clustering.
